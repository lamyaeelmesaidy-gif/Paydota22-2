/home/runner/work/Paydota22/Paydota22/android/app/src/main/res/drawable-land-hdpi/ic_launcher.png: Error: The drawable "ic_launcher" in drawable-land-hdpi has no declaration in the base drawable folder or in a drawable-densitydpi folder; this can lead to crashes when the drawable is queried in a configuration that does not match this qualifier [MissingDefaultResource]
   Explanation for issues of type "MissingDefaultResource":
   If a resource is only defined in folders with qualifiers like -land or -en,
   and there is no default declaration in the base folder (layout or values
   etc), then the app will crash if that resource is accessed on a device
   where the device is in a configuration missing the given qualifier.
   As a special case, drawables do not have to be specified in the base
   folder; if there is a match in a density folder (such as drawable-mdpi)
   that image will be used and scaled. Note however that if you  only specify
   a drawable in a folder like drawable-en-hdpi, the app will crash in
   non-English locales.
   There may be scenarios where you have a resource, such as a -fr drawable,
   which is only referenced from some other resource with the same qualifiers
   (such as a -fr style), which itself has safe fallbacks. However, this still
   makes it possible for somebody to accidentally reference the drawable and
   crash, so it is safer to create a default fallback in the base folder.
   Alternatively, you can suppress the issue by adding
   tools:ignore="MissingDefaultResource" on the element.
   (This scenario frequently happens with string translations, where you might
   delete code and the corresponding resources, but forget to delete a
   translation. There is a dedicated issue id for that scenario, with the id
   ExtraTranslation.)
